### Description

With the ever increasing use of user id's and passwords it gets harder for a user to remember these all. So why not just allow your applications to use a users PC Login Username and Password.

I have attached a module that I found on Microsofts webpage while surfing the net for exactly that. I have placed a piece of code that shows how to use this module.

I have used it in a Network Tools application I have written to verifiy the administrators or users username and password.

It saves having different usernames and passwords for each application.

A handy addition to any login screen.
